二、基本術語

Term	Description
Alarm	
An alarm is related to any abnormal situation on the equipment that may endanger people, equipment, or material being processed" [SEMI E30, 2]. GEM allows the host to be notified when alarm conditions are detected and cleared. 

設備處於非正常運行，可能危害操作員、設備或無聊的情況下，GEM允許當檢測到告警或清除告警后通知host主機。

Collection Event	
A collection event is a "detectable occurrence significant to the equipment" that "is considered to be significant to the host". [SEMI E30, 2] GEM allows the host to be notified when a collection event occurs. This allows the host to track the equipment's activity.

對於設備而言是可檢測的事件信號。

Data Variable	
Data variables "…may only be valid upon the occurrence of a particular event". [SEMI E5, 6.6]. The host can gather data variable values from the GEM Equipment. The data variable values provide information specifically related to the event.

針對某一特定事件才有效。主機能獲取某一事件所有的數據變量值。

Equipment Constant	
Equipment Constants are "settable by the Host"[SEMI E5 6.6]. The host can gather equipment constant values from the GEM Equipment. The host can also set equipment constant values on the GEM Equipment to control the equipment's behavior.

可被主機讀取或設置的設備特性數據。

GEM Equipment	
An "intelligent system which communicates with a host" [SEMI E4, 2.1] and complies to the SECS/GEM standard.

就是一個遵循SECS/GEM協議標准，並能與主機進行通信的設備系統。

Host	
"An intelligent system which communicates with the equipment." [SEMI E4, 2.1]. The host can be viewed as a line management system. GEM does not intend to define how the host should behave. The GEM SECS standard defines the set of messages a host must use when interacting with GEM Equipment. A GEM Equipment can communicate with one host. A host can communicate with multiple GEM Equipment.

就是一個線性控制系統（系統當然包含了依附在硬件上的軟件）

HSMS-SS	
SEMI standard High Speed Message Service-Single Session which defines TCP/IP network communication used by SECS/GEM for host/equipment communication. It is replacing the SECS-I standard. Only one client host can use a specific port at a time.

在SECS/GEM標准中通過定義TCP/IP網絡通信協議在單客戶端-主機的情況下使用指定端口下可替換SECS-1。

PV2	GUIDE FOR PV EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATION INTERFACES (PVECI), based on SECS/GEM, specifically for photovoltaic equipment suppliers.
Process Program	A Recipe (see Recipe)
Recipe	A set of instructions for the equipment.
Report	
"A set of variables predefined by the equipment or defined by the host…". The host uses reports to gather status variable, data variable, and equipment constant values. The host can request a report explicitly or attach a set of reports to a collection event.

就是應答。

Status Variable	
"Status variables may include any parameters that can be sampled in time such as temperature or quantity of a consumable（消耗品數量）." [SEMI E5, 6.5] "Status values … always contain valid information." [SEMI E5, 6.6]. The host can gather status variable values from the GEM Equipment.

SECS-I	
SEMI Equipment Communications Standard 1 Message Transfer - defines RS-232 serial communication used by SECS/GEM for host/equipment communication. It is phasing out due to inherent speed limitations. It is being replaced by the HSMS standard.

現階段由於自身速度的限制，已逐步被HSMS標准替代。

SECS-II	SEMI Equipment Communications Standard 2 Message Content. SECS GEM is a specific implementation of the SECS-II standard. SECS-II defines most concepts and functionality used in the SECS/GEM standard. Many SECS-II capable systems are not GEM compliant.
SECS-II Message	All GEM Equipment and host communication is accomplished using SECS-II messages. Each unique SECS-II message is identified by its stream number (S) and function number (F). The SECS-II standard defines a large set of SECS-II messages determining each one's purpose, content, and usage. The SECS GEM standard defines how to use a subset of these SECS-II messages yet allows other SECS-II messages to be used in addition to this subset.
